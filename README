Rev. 2 Features
-Search button retrieves key-enter coordinates into the address TextField
-Address is now formatted to rectify layout issues; still need to 'fix' layout in view
-Coordinate TextFields now accept multiple formats:
    -Format may be either decimal or sexagesimal
    -Direction may be either ordinal or operator-based
-Auto-detect of user input still needs work
    -State switches need debugging
    -Fall through needs optimized
    -Needs recall to compare to prior digit possibilities
    -Without the floating validation mask, some coordinates may bug out
-Minutes seconds notation needs decimal support
-Minus sign should function as a directional switch if not in first position
